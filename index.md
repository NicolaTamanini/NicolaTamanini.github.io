Hi! My name is Nicola Tamanini and I am a researcher working on gravitational wave astronomy, and in particular its implications in astrophysics, cosmology and fundamental physics.

This is my personal webpage where you will be able to find information on my present and past research activities. Please use the menu on the left to navigate this webspace and feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
