# Curriculum Vitae

On this page you can find an extended version of my CV, including all relevant academic activities. A short summary is provided at the top. A two-page version of the CV is also available for download [[pdf](/source/CV_Tamanini.pdf)] (latest update 19/08/2025).

### In a nutshell

My higher education consists in a BSc in physics (2008) and an MSc in theoretical and computational physics (2010) from the University of Trento (Italy), completed by a PhD in applied mathematics (2014) at University College London (UK). Throughout my MSc and PhD I mainly studied different theoretical and mathematical aspects of alternative theories of gravity and cosmology. In 2014 I started my first postdoc position at the Institut de Physique Théorique at CEA Saclay (France), where I worked on physical cosmology and started research on gravitational waves, joining the LISA Consortium. In 2017 I moved for my second postdoc position to the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute) in Potsdam (Germany), where I joined the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and focused my research on different cosmological and astrophysical applications of gravitational wave astronomy. From 2021 I am a CNRS Directeur de Recherche at the Laboratoire des 2 Infinis - Toulouse (France), where I lead the gravitational wave group which is part of the LISA Consortium, the Virgo Collaboration, and the Einstein Telescope Consortium.
