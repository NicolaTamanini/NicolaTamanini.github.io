### My research in the news

#### Strongly lensed EMRIs

At the L2IT, I coordinated a team of students and researchers to investigate whether extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), binary systems composed by a massive black hole and a stellar-mass compact object, can be strongly lensed by galaxies along the line-of-sight between the source and the future space-based gravitational-wave detector LISA. If this happens, LISA will observe more than one gravitational-wave signal, which would correspond to different images of the original signal. This will provide a new target signal for LISA composed by overlapping EMRI signals arriving from the same direction in the sky, which could provide new insights into astrophysics and cosmology.

#### Using gravitational waves to discover new exoplanets

Together with Camilla Danielski, I proposed a new observational method to detect circumbinary exoplanets using gravitational waves. In particular we showed how the planned space-based gravitational-wave observatory LISA can detect exoplanets orbiting white dwarf binaries everywhere in our Milky Way, overcoming in this way the limitations of electromagnetic techniques which can search for exoplanets only within the Solar System neighbourhood.
