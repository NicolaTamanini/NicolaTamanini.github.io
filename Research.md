# Research

Work in progress...

My research activity mainly concerns cosmology and gravitational waves, and specifically the interplay between these two topics. In particular I am interested in understating and employing standard sirens to probe the expansion of the universe and to obtain useful information on the fundamental nature of dark energy. Further personal research interests include dynamical systems applications to cosmology, modified theories of gravity and gravitational waveform modelling from astrophysical sources.
