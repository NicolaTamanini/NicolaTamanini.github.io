# Gravitational wave research at L2IT

<img src="/assets/img/L2IT_logo.jpg" height="120" />

The [Laboratoire des 2 infinis - Toulouse (L2IT)](https://www.l2it.in2p3.fr) is a research institute of IN2P3/CNRS established in 2020 with the objective to pursue fundamental research with innovative numerical and theoretical approaches. The research of the institute is focused on particle physics, gravitational waves and the nuclear equation of state, and it is supported by a complementary development of numerical computing, data analysis and data science methodologies.

The gravitational wave group at L2IT conducts research on both theoretical and experimental aspects of gravitational wave science, with a distinct focus at exploiting new ideas connecting theory with observations through data analysis and numerical simulations. The group is part of the [LISA Consortium](https://www.lisamission.org), the [Virgo Collaboration](https://www.virgo-gw.eu) and the [Einstein Telescope Consortium](https://www.et-gw.eu), and conducts cutting-edge research on gravitational waves collaborating with external groups and institutes at local, national and international levels.
